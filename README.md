Data source and description: [kaggle competition - House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

### Problem Description

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Practice Skills

* Creative feature engineering 
* Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

### Cloud deployment

This project was deployed to Heroku cloud.
To deploy this project you don't need any additional code, just create file Procfile with 1 line:
```
web: gunicorn predict:app
```
and follow the official guide to push this repo to Heroku - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git

In `predict_test.py` Jupyter notebook you can find how to test the service endpoint.

There may be some problems when trying to run `git push heroku master`

use email as login and token as password 
```
heroku auth:token
```

Don't forget to specify Buildpacks - `heroku/python` in heroku project
